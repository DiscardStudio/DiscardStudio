                <h2>Misfits Making Games</h2>
                <p>Discard Studio is a Small Group of Friends who finally decided "Let's Make a Video Game" shouldn't just be a turn of phrase.</p>
                <p>>Millions of people currently in their 20s right now have had the thought. Hundreds of Thousands have the skills.</p>
                <p>How many actually decide to put themselves out there and try?</p>
                <br/>
                <p>For the longest time, We were among the many. Among those who decided it wasn't worth trying.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>Among those who told us not to try.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>I'm used to people playing the Devil's Advocate. Frankly, I got pretty sick of it myself.</p>
                <br/>
                <p>I've decided to do what I love, for the Love of the Game. And for that, I've been called Unrealistic.</p>
                <br/>
                <h1>Boo Fucking Who.</h1>
                <p>Yeah, we'll be fine.</p>
                <p>I don't want to hear any more "Devil's Advocates". Look me in the eyes and be inspired or get the fuck out of the way.</p>
